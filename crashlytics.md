Firebase Crashlytics collects and reports crashes and errors that occured in apps. When app is Crashlytics enabled, it keeps a log of events occurred alongside Dart stacktraces to be reported with crash report. The carsh report is sent when the app opens next time.

# Set-up

## `pubspec.yaml` dependency

Add `TODO` plugin dependency as below:

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^0.7.0"
  firebase_crashlytics: "^0.4.0+1"

```

Run `flutter pub get` to refresh Flutter packages.

Refer [Flutter Fire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/crashlytics/overview#1-add-dependency) for incorporating null-safety.

## Android

`android/build.gradle`
```
dependencies {
  ...
  classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.2.0'
}

```

`android/app/build.gradle`
```
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

# Crashlytics plugin
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

## iOS

1. Open Xcode
2. Select 'Runner' under 'Targets' and open 'Build Phases' tab.
3. Click on '+' and Choose 'New Run Script Phase'. Add `${PODS_ROOT}/FirebaseCrashlytics/run` in the script box.
4. Add `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(INFOPLIST_PATH)` in 'Input Files' to provide `Info.plist` location.

# Integrating Firebase Craslytics 

The crashlytics reports are sent when app is restarted after a crash.

## Importing Pacakge
```
import 'package:firebase_crashlytics/firebase_crashlytics.dart';
```

## Initializing
In day to day development, you may not want to report all crashes to Crashlytics. You can choose to disable reporting to Firebase Crashlytics when your app is in debug mode.

```
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' show kDebugMode;

Future<Widget> initializeApp(AppConfig appConfig) async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  FirebaseDatabase.instance.setPersistenceEnabled(true);

  //Disable Crashlytics reporting in debug mode.
  if (kDebugMode) {
    await FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(false);
  }
  return MyApp(appConfig);
}
```

When testing integrating, you may want to enable the crashlytics reporting like this:
```
await FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(true);
```
The above will report crashes during development.

## Forcing a crash
If you don't want to wait for a crash to happen during integration, you can force a crash like this:
```
FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.crash();
```
---

## Reporting User identifiers in Crash Reports
You may want to track down which user is experiecing the crash. An user identifiers  can be reported in the crash reports like this:
```
  FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.setUserIdentifier("counterappDevUser12345");
```

## Handling Flutter Framework Uncaught Errors

You can pass all the uncaught Flutter framework errors to Crashlytics to be included in the crash reports.
```
FlutterError.onError = FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.recordFlutterError;
```
