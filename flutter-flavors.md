In this article, I will give overview of the process of publishing Flutter applications on Android and iOS platforms in multiple environments. In real-world applications development process, there are multiple environments and/or stages an applications is released in. During development stage, you may want to share your app to internal testers with a backend configured for development but not ready for production purpose. If you want to distribute your app to internal testers, you need a `dev` variant for the application.

When you are ready to roll-out the application for public release and have production backend ready, you need a variant of same app which is connected to the production backend. Let's call this variant of app as `prod` flavor.

# Pre-requisites

In this article, I will use default `CounterApp` in two variants or flavors: `dev` for development, and `prod` for production. Let's assume this app uses Firebase for backend. The `dev` flavor/variant of app uses one instance of Firebase project, and `prod` flavor uses different instance of Firebase project.

# Android

# Firebase Configuration Files
Firebase configuration files go under in their flavor folders under `android/app/src/`.
* dev flavor: `android/app/src/dev/google-services.json`
* prod flavor: `android/app/src/prod/google-services.json`

# Flavors

Define flavors in `app/build.gradle`.

```
android {


    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.pcc.counterapp"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 29
        versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName flutterVersionName
    }

    ...

    flavorDimensions "counterapp"

    productFlavors {
        dev {
            dimension "counterapp"
            applicationIdSuffix ".dev"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Counter App Dev"
            versionNameSuffix ".dev"
        }
        prod {
            dimension "counterapp"
            applicationIdSuffix ".prod"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Counter App Prod"
            versionNameSuffix ".prod"
        }
    }
}
```

 # iOS

 We need to setup custom schemes at iOS side.

 # Firebase Configuration Files


 # Custom Schemes
 * Create Scheme: dev -> Create debug, release and profile configuration for this new scheme (Project Runner -> Configuration-> Duplicate debug, release and profile configs for dev scheme)
 * Rename existing Runner default scheme to prod.
 * Manage scheme -> Assign correct configuration to its corresponding scheme.


 # Scheme specific Product bundle identifier
 * Targets -> Runner -> Build Settings -> Product Bundle Identifier
 Assign the correct bundle identifier for each item as shown in image[product_bundle_identifiers].

# Firebase Config files
* Copy GooglePlayServices files under `config/dev` and `config/prod`.
* Copy the `config` folder into the Xcode (drag and drop under Runner project)
* Targets -> Runner -> Build Phase: Add script to copy correct GooglePlaySerivce file for the correct scheme.
Move the script right after

```
environment="default"

# Regex to extract the scheme name from the Build Configuration
# We have named our Build Configurations as Debug-dev, Debug-prod etc.
# Here, dev and prod are the scheme names. This kind of naming is required by Flutter for flavors to work.
# We are using the $CONFIGURATION variable available in the XCode build environment to extract
# the environment (or flavor)
# For eg.
# If CONFIGURATION="Debug-prod", then environment will get set to "prod".
if [[ $CONFIGURATION =~ -([^-]*)$ ]]; then
environment=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}
fi

echo $environment

# Name and path of the resource we're copying
GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_PLIST=GoogleService-Info.plist
GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_FILE=${PROJECT_DIR}/config/${environment}/${GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_PLIST}

# Make sure GoogleService-Info.plist exists
echo "Looking for ${GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_PLIST} in ${GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_FILE}"
if [ ! -f $GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_FILE ]
then
echo "No GoogleService-Info.plist found. Please ensure it's in the proper directory."
exit 1
fi

# Get a reference to the destination location for the GoogleService-Info.plist
# This is the default location where Firebase init code expects to find GoogleServices-Info.plist file
PLIST_DESTINATION=${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PRODUCT_NAME}.app
echo "Will copy ${GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_PLIST} to final destination: ${PLIST_DESTINATION}"

# Copy over the prod GoogleService-Info.plist for Release builds
cp "${GOOGLESERVICE_INFO_FILE}" "${PLIST_DESTINATION}"
```


[TODO: Add recording of creating dev scheme]

At this point, if you run `flutter run --flavor dev` in CLI, you will see information to complete the custom scheme.
```
The Xcode project defines build configurations: Debug, Release, Profile
Flutter expects a build configuration named Debug-dev or similar.
Open Xcode to fix the problem:
  open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
1. Click on "Runner" in the project navigator.
2. Ensure the Runner PROJECT is selected, not the Runner TARGET.
3. Click the Editor->Add Configuration->Duplicate "Debug" Configuration.

   If this option is disabled, it is likely you have the target selected instead
   of the project; see:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19842746/adding-a-build-configuration-in-xcode

   If you have created a completely custom set of build configurations,
   you can set the FLUTTER_BUILD_MODE=debug
   in the .xcconfig file for that configuration and run from Xcode.

4. If you are not using completely custom build configurations, name the newly created configuration debug.
Could not build the precompiled application for the device.
```
